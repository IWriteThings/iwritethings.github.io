Welcome to my GitHub Pages site!

This site began as a new supporting project for [my personal blog][1].

My idea for this site is to post my writing projects, coding projects, and all
things in relation to my work on The Tarot Gamer project. I appreciate the time you took to read this and hope that this GitHub account will bring you plenty of entertainment as well as maybe help you in some other way.

Reach out to me if you would like [on twitter][2].
