I adore GitHub. You can probably tell by the fact that I use GitHub for
all of my technical needs. I blog, write stories, program, and live in
the GitHub ecosystem. I am a strong proponent of open source software
that encourages collaboration, so GitHub is great for me.

I am cognizant of the fact that GitHub is an external host for data.
This means that my documents, files, and any code submitted to GitHub
could potentially be lost in the event of a catastrophic failure at
GitHub. Then how do we safe guard our data? Enter [Dropbox][01]!

Dropbox is a tool that allows you to assign folders to be automatically
uploaded to the cloud in order to backup that data. I use Dropbox for
storing all of my Git enabled repositories, my music, and all of my
images. You can even encrypt files if you are concerned about their
privacy or security. However, for projects already being stored on
GitHub, I don't see the point.

So how do these two tools meld in order to provide peace of mind?
Simple! Just clone your repositories in GitHub into a Dropbox folder.
You will then have your information stored locally, on GitHub, and in
the cloud on Dropbox servers. You can use alternative tools like AWS or
other cloud tools but Dropbox has been the simplest for me to use.

I have the maximum number of Dropbox referrals and I also registered a
Samsung device at Dropbox, this provides me about 70 gigabytes of space
on Dropbox for free. You will have significantly less available to you
as a new Dropbox user. I recommend looking at a website called Fiverr in
order to assist you with this issue. Google is your friend.
