I decided it would be a good idea to create a new post template. It is very
simple and just allows me to add additional meta data about my posts. I am
planning on expanding my site some so this meta data should become useful for
me. I want to add pagination to my posts, a blog page, and improve my RSS feed.

I am going to add a tag and category search to the site as well.
