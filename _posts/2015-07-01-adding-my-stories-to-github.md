I have started posting my fiction to my GitHub account. I will be moving all
works of fiction that I write to my GitHub account in order to help me organize
and curate my works of art. I really enjoy writing.

- Book 1 / [Full Metal Panic Goddess Complex][01]
- Book 2 / [Full Metal Panic Goddess Collision][02]

These are my initial commits for my two fiction stories. You can even download
the stories in the form of PDF under the release section or use my make file
combined with pdflatex to compile your own copy of the PDF.

Reach out to me if you would like [on twitter][99].
