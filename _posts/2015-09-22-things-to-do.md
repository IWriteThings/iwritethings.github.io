It is that time of the year again. We are coming up on the new year within the
next few months and I need to start creating my "to-do" list. I have been
working, creating, and trying to stay busy as I finish up my last list of
things I had created.

Every year I sit down and I make a list of things that I want to do over the
coming year. I then tick off the list as I accomplish those things or eliminate
them if something better comes along. I find it helps me stay focused if I know
what I want to do and how as I work through the year.

I usually break things down by cost and when I want to do it.

My current brainstorm consists of the following.

### Free
- Finish Goddess Collision story
- Buckle down and write my own book (Stop sitting on my outline)
- Create Blog Posts (2 per week?)
    - Tech Stuff?
    - Occult / Religious / Tarot stuff
- Make more YouTube Videos (2 per week?)
    - More let's plays?
    - Maybe a tech support video series.
- Become more fluent in WordPress (See.Do.Teach.)
    - Make blog posts or youtube videos to help me with remembering things I
      learn.
- Finish the basic layout and content of the Jekyll Site
    - Add a URL

### Cost
- Upgrade my computer and monitor to 4K support. (3rd Quarter 2016)
    - Video Card Upgrade (Is my processor good enough?)
    - Monitor Upgrade (SCEPTRE TV?)
- Buy a new computer desk / chair (obutto)
- Time for new shoes (4th Quarter 2015)

### Unknown
- Find a way to start supporting a charity

This is my current list of things to do and accomplish that I would like to
focus on as we enter 2016. I am sure the list will evolve as things progress,
but I think it is a good start as far as knowing what I need to focus on when I
am not working.
