As I was learning how to stream on Twitch.TV I realized that there were
not very many good resources for learning the intricacies of the craft.
There are plenty of web pages out there that include a few snippets
about how a person does "X" or "Y" but no real step by step assistance
in getting started as a first time streamer. You really are expected to
figure it out on your own as you work.

I am going to start the process by showing what my "battle station"
looks like for Twitch. I have several tools that I set up that assist me
in streaming my content that you all may be interested in seeing to get
a visual idea of how this whole thing works. The nice thing is that most
of this equipment serves multiple purposes.

Let's start with the general setup -

Here you can see the majority of what I need to stream successfully. The
contents are listed here.

- Computer
- Capture Device
- Microphone
- Game Systems
    - WII U
    - Dreamcast
- Router / Internet
- Network Attached Storage
- Up converter
- Second monitor / television

If you are interested in streaming, you can start with just a computer and some
free screen capture software. Streaming console or hand held devices will
require additional equipment that can drastically increase the cost of entry to
the act of streaming.

You can begin experimenting with streaming on Twitch with just a single computer
and some software for video capture. I will discuss software during a later
post. Right now I want to focus on my own equipment that I use.

1. Computer
   
    You need a computer with an acceptably fast processor. I recommend
    at least an I5 from Intel. You should also attempt to have at least
    8GB of ram for your computer. Streaming can be processor intensive,
    so you want to have plenty of power behind your setup if you can
    afford it. I use a Macbook Air and it is plenty fast enough to
    handle streaming external devices like game consoles.

    If you are saving your stream contents to your hard drive you will
    want to invest in a solid state drive. You do not want to limit
    yourself to the speed of your drive. I have a USB 3.0 case that
    accepts a hard drive and I keep a solid state drive in it that I can
    write to if I decide I want to record instead of simply streaming.

2. Capture Device

    I use an Elgato HD60 device purchased from Best Buy because I had
    a gift card. All of my devices I want to stream can be streamed
    using HDMI using a conversion box, so I am plenty happy to use this
    device. Other companies provide other streaming devices. Pick the
    one that supports your needs if necessary.

    Your choice in streaming tools will be dependent on your goals as a
    streamer. If you only plan to stream content found locally on your
    computer, you will not necessarily need an external device. However,
    a major caveat to this is the fact that it is possible to employ two
    computers for streaming. You may have a gaming PC you use for gaming
    while using a second PC to stream the content of the first from an
    HDMI connection.

    I only stream console content as of this document so I do not need
    two computers. If you are interested in using two computers, send me
    a tweet or contact me in the comments and I can look into building
    some kind of tutorial on multi system streaming.

3. Microphone

    Blue Yeti. I bought mine as an open box item for about $30. They are
    the best microphone in my humble opinion and you will find that most
    professional streamers use one. Get you one.

4. NAS ( Network Attached Storage )

    This is another optional item but if you want to backup large
    amounts of video, it can help to have an easy way to do it. I use a
    NAS made by Netgear. They are well worth it but you can substitute
    an external drive just as easy.

5. Game Systems

    I use the Sega Dreamcast and the WII U for my streaming. I can
    also use the original WII. The nice thing about Nintendo consoles
    is their habit of providing a single generation of backwards
    compatibility. I can stream WII, WII U, Gamecube, and Dreamcast
    games all from HDMI thanks to my choice of up converter box.
    This guarantees me a near life time worth of content of multiple
    generations of consoles. In addition, any system that employs HDMI
    or has the capability to be converted to HDMI can be used as well.

    I believe my setup will handle at least two more generations worth
    of consoles before it will be necessary for me to upgrade to what
    ever eventually replaces HDMI.

6. Up converter

    VGA/YPbPr HDMI Converter from a local electronics store. This is
    a bit pricey but will open up a world of consoles as long as they
    support VGA or component cable. I have a VGA box for my Dreamcast
    so I am easily able to go from the VGA 480P to 1080P. My WII has
    component cables and my converter can handle those as well. As
    mentioned earlier this means I can easily stream several generations
    worth of content thanks to this single device.
   
   ![converter][converter]

It is possible to stream using an array of different tools and software. The way
I do it is not necessarily the best and as you probably can tell, I do not have
an external camera for capturing myself while I play. You may be interested in
adding some kind of video capture system and software for grabbing that as well.

In my next post I will discuss the software I use and how to employ all of the
physicals tools I showed here in order to easily capture game play for Twitch,
Youtube, or other video display systems.
